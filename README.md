## ‚ú® Features

This application implements all the mandatory features from the submission criteria, along with several suggested features to achieve a higher score.

### Core Features

* **User Authentication**
    * **Register:** New users can sign up with a name, email, and password.
    * **Login:** Existing users can log in using their email and password.
    * **Session Management:** The app saves user sessions and auth tokens. Users who are already logged in are taken directly to the main screen.
    * **Logout:** Users can log out, which clears their session data and token.

* **Custom View with Validation**
    * A custom `EditText` component is used for the password field.
    * It provides an immediate error message if the password is less than 8 characters long.

* **Story Feed**
    * Displays a list of stories fetched from the API.
    * Each item in the list shows the user's name and the story's photo.
    * The latest story appears at the top of the list after being added.

* **Story Details**
    * Tapping on a story opens a detail screen showing the user's name, photo, and full description.

* **Add New Story**
    * Users can create a new story by uploading an image and adding a description.
    * Images can be selected from the device **Gallery**.
    * Upon successful upload, the user is returned to the main story feed, which is refreshed to show the new story.
